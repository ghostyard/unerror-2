                        i’m k, my pronouns are she/they, i’m 25, my time zone’s pst, and
                        there’s a lot to say here, so let’s get into it.
                      </div>
                    <p>
                      <span>CONTENT WARNING</span> this blog will have a lot of triggering
                      content, including but not limited to: mental illness (specifically
                      dissociative identity disorder, depression, and anxiety), violence,
                      drug usage, trauma, and current events. i tag for all of this as
                      trigger tw, which translates as mental illness tw, drugs tw, etc.
                      because of this, i <b>will not write with minors</b>.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      <span>ACTIVITY</span> this is a low activity blog. i will be on and
                      off here as my brain works, and if i’m not here, you might find me at
                      <b>@debtbound</b>.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      <span>SHIPPING</span> i can ship, but i’m very careful about who i do
                      and don’t ship with. elliot is, again, a lot for himself and even more
                      of a handful for other people, so anything we do will have to be
                      plotted out.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      <span>WRITING & STYLE</span> i don't use icons and i use normal sized
                      text. i don't mind if other people use small text. double small text
                      can be hard for me to read sometimes. also, although i generally write
                      in third person, i like first person threads. you'll never meet a guy
                      more befitting of first person threads than elliot alderson.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      <span>ON CANON</span> i basically follow the canon of the show.
                      there’s very little that i change besides some notes that you can see
                      in the <b>portrayal section</b> on this page.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      <span>INTERACTIONS</span> elliot by his nature basically demands
                      plotting before interacting. ask memes can also be very helpful for
                      me, since it lets me mess around in his head about a person before
                      getting into something. i may occasionally put out starter calls, but
                      they won’t be as frequent on this blog as other blogs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <span>NEED A SUMMARY?</span> i genuinely recommend reading the wiki
                      summaries of the show. if you want to chat about anything or have
                      questions, let me know!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>001</span> elliot is not a particularly nice person.
                        he’s trying to do good, but he is hampered by paranoia and severe
                        mental illness. even in post-canon, when it's more controlled, it is a
                        long and difficult uphill battle. he will lie to your muse. he will
                        dissociate and talk to the reader just to get the hell out of there. he is often compelled to hack just
                        about everyone he meets. he does not trust easily.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <span>002</span> please be respectful about mental illness on here.
                        there is no such thing as a 'bad' alter. every alter has their purpose
                        and a reason that they needed to exist, regardless of how kind or
                        agreeable they are.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <span>003</span> i interpret elliot as a trans man. terfs and
                        transphobes can fuck off. he uses <b>he/him</b> pronouns generally.
                        this means that pronouns can sometimes be a little unclear on this
                        blog. please note that "they" is often used to refer to the system as
                        a whole.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <span>004</span> i diverge from canon on a few things, more to fit my
                        portrayal than any actual issues with canon. something important to
                        note is that each of his parents had pre-existing marriages. elliot
                        was his mother's biological child, and when they were married, he was
                        around two or three years old and darlene had just been born to his
                        father's prior marriage. this technically makes them adoptive
                        siblings.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <span>005</span> plotting during the canon of mr. robot can be
                        incredibly difficult. all 45 episodes of its show happen across,
                        basically, march 2015 to december 2015. elliot is basically not
                        available for significant portions of time during that. it's easiest
                        to plot with them post-canon, and some things might be placed
                        pre-canon.
