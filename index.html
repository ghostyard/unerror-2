                        i’m k, my pronouns are she/they, i’m 25, my time zone’s pst, and
                        there’s a lot to say here, so let’s get into it.
                      </div>
                    <p>
                      <span>CONTENT WARNING</span> this blog will have a lot of triggering
                      content, including but not limited to: mental illness (specifically
                      dissociative identity disorder, depression, and anxiety), violence,
                      drug usage, trauma, and current events. i tag for all of this as
                      trigger tw, which translates as mental illness tw, drugs tw, etc.
                      because of this, i <b>will not write with minors</b>.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      <span>ACTIVITY</span> this is a low activity blog. i will be on and
                      off here as my brain works, and if i’m not here, you might find me at
                      <b>@debtbound</b>.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      <span>SHIPPING</span> i can ship, but i’m very careful about who i do
                      and don’t ship with. elliot is, again, a lot for himself and even more
                      of a handful for other people, so anything we do will have to be
                      plotted out.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      <span>WRITING & STYLE</span> i don't use icons and i use normal sized
                      text. i don't mind if other people use small text. double small text
                      can be hard for me to read sometimes. also, although i generally write
                      in third person, i like first person threads. you'll never meet a guy
                      more befitting of first person threads than elliot alderson.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      <span>ON CANON</span> i basically follow the canon of the show.
                      there’s very little that i change besides some notes that you can see
                      in the <b>portrayal section</b> on this page.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      <span>INTERACTIONS</span> elliot by his nature basically demands
                      plotting before interacting. ask memes can also be very helpful for
                      me, since it lets me mess around in his head about a person before
                      getting into something. i may occasionally put out starter calls, but
                      they won’t be as frequent on this blog as other blogs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <span>NEED A SUMMARY?</span> i genuinely recommend reading the wiki
                      summaries of the show. if you want to chat about anything or have
                      questions, let me know!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>001</span> elliot is not a particularly nice person.
                        he’s trying to do good, but he is hampered by paranoia and severe
                        mental illness. even in post-canon, when it's more controlled, it is a
                        long and difficult uphill battle. he will lie to your muse. he will
                        dissociate and talk to the reader just to get the hell out of there. he is often compelled to hack just
                        about everyone he meets. he does not trust easily.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <span>002</span> please be respectful about mental illness on here.
                        there is no such thing as a 'bad' alter. every alter has their purpose
                        and a reason that they needed to exist, regardless of how kind or
                        agreeable they are.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <span>003</span> i interpret elliot as a trans man. terfs and
                        transphobes can fuck off. he uses <b>he/him</b> pronouns generally.
                        this means that pronouns can sometimes be a little unclear on this
                        blog. please note that "they" is often used to refer to the system as
                        a whole.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <span>004</span> i diverge from canon on a few things, more to fit my
                        portrayal than any actual issues with canon. something important to
                        note is that each of his parents had pre-existing marriages. elliot
                        was his mother's biological child, and when they were married, he was
                        around two or three years old and darlene had just been born to his
                        father's prior marriage. this technically makes them adoptive
                        siblings.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <span>005</span> plotting during the canon of mr. robot can be
                        incredibly difficult. all 45 episodes of its show happen across,
                        basically, march 2015 to december 2015. elliot is basically not
                        available for significant portions of time during that. it's easiest
                        to plot with them post-canon, and some things might be placed
                        pre-canon.

            <p><b>imagine a world like ours, but a few seconds closer to midnight.</b></p> the world of <i>mr. robot</i>
              is barely outside of the one we live in. it's a little grimier, a little angrier, and a lot
              more prone to revolution. it's got economic collapse, rampant
              capitalism left so completely unfettered that it's formed enormous conglomerates, everyone 
              drowning in debt and work.</p>
              <p>it's about being so particularly and paralyzingly alone that living in the world becomes
              so untenable that it has to change. then it asks the question: what happens after you change
              the world, and everything keeps turning anyway, way outside your control? 
              </p>
              <p>this naturally fits into: <b>crime</b>, <b>near-future sci-fi</b>, <b>urban fantasy</b>, 
              <b>certain kinds of horror</b>. anything else is workable. you'd be shocked how easy it is 
              to find an analogue for hacking in most settings.</p>
              <p>themes: neo-noir, technology, social isolation, revolution, anti-capitalism, trauma, and mental illness.</p>

              <ul>
                  <li><b>FSOCIETY</b> - a secretive hacker collective formed in 2015 focused on the elimination of debt. the group took credit for 5/9, where all of e corp's debt records were encrypted, an incident in which 71 e corp buildings were blown up, and a massive document dump on the one hundred richest people in the world.</li>
                  <li><b>E CORP</b> - one of the largest multi-national conglomerates in the world who, prior to 5/9, owned 70% of the global consumer credit industry. still one of the world's most important corporations, although its reputation has been somewhat diminished.</li>
                  <li><b>DARK ARMY</b> - a notorious worldwide hacker-for-hire collective, intensely secretive yet infamous. in truth, the dark army worked directly for <b>whiterose</b> as a tool of violence and intimidation, although it seems to have dissolved after its leader's death.</li>
                  <li><b>DEUS GROUP</b> - an investment group formed by the world's one hundred richest people to manipulate global events for profit. in truth, this was another tool used by whiterose to construct towards a machine, established in washington township for the purposes of finding another world.</li>

                <li>elliot alderson was associated with stopping the washington township nuclear plant from melting down over christmas 2015.</li>
                <li>everyone else in the power plant died, including the leader of the infamous deus group, a collection of the hundred or so richest people in the world.</li>
                <li>fsociety, a hacker collective, outed the deus group. they were also responsible for 5/9 in early 2015, which encrypted most debt records and tanked the economy. someone—likely fsociety—later fixed that by emailing the encryption key to e corp.</li>
                <li>they're also associated with blowing up 71 buildings and killing thousands of people. there's a lot of talk about that one.</li>

                  <li>sepi0l is an infamous and nigh-invisible hacker who disappeared for most of 2015 and then resurfaced in late 2016.</li>
                  <li>no one really knows anything about the original members of fsociety. there was a secondary group that popped up after 5/9, but the footprint wasn't the same.</li>
                  <li>lots of rumors about fsociety in general. people say they were a part of it, but that might not be true. there's plenty of groups who popped up trying to be their successors, too.</li>
                  <li>in terms of work, sepi0l spends a lot of time on irc boards and has written some fucking unhinged malware. they love open source projects and they hate suits, whether government or business.</li>

                  <li>elliot alderson was investigated by the fbi in connection to fsociety, 5/9, and the 71 buildings. he wasn't charged. a lot of it seems to rest at the feet of now-deceased e corp cto tyrell wellick.</li>
                  <li>if you're at a high enough clearance level, you know more about the details. elliot's sister was briefly arrested in connection to fsociety. it appears that a lot of what happened was related to the dark army, a criminal hacking syndicate used by the deus group as their muscle.</li>
